        <h2>Cricket</h2>
        <p>Sri Lankan cricket is the cricket team representing Sri Lanka, an island country in the Indian Ocean. The
          team is a full member of the International Cricket Council (ICC) and participates in Test, One Day
          International (ODI) and Twenty20 International (T20I) matches.<br><br>

          Sri Lanka has a long history of cricket, dating back to the early 19th century. The country has a strong
          domestic cricket structure and has produced many talented cricketers over the years. Some of the most famous
          Sri Lankan cricketers include Muttiah Muralitharan, Kumar Sangakkara, Mahela Jayawardene, and Sanath
          Jayasuriya.<br><br>

          Sri Lanka has had success on the international stage, including winning the Cricket World Cup in 1996 and
          reaching the final in 2007 and 2011. The team has also won the Asian Test Championship, the Asian Cup, and the
          ICC Intercontinental Cup. In recent years, however, the team has struggled to maintain its success and has
          faced criticism for its poor performances. Despite this, Sri Lanka remains a formidable cricketing nation and
          continues to produce talented cricketers who represent the country with pride.</p>
