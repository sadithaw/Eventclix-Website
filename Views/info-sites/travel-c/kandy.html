      <h1>History</h1>

      <p>Kandy is a city located in the central province of Sri Lanka. It is the second largest city in the country and
        is considered the cultural capital of Sri Lanka. The city has a long and rich history dating back to the 14th
        century.<br><br>

        According to legend, Kandy was founded by King Vikramabahu III of Gampola, who named the city Senkadagalapura.
        It later came under the control of the Kingdom of Kandy, which was a powerful kingdom in the central highlands
        of the island. The Kingdom of Kandy was known for its cultural and religious achievements and played a major
        role in the history of Sri Lanka.<br><br>

        During the colonial period, Kandy was the capital of the Kingdom of Kandy, which was a protectorate of the
        British Empire. The city played a significant role in the struggle for independence and was the site of the
        Kandy Convention, which marked the end of British rule in the country.<br><br>

        Today, Kandy is a major tourist destination in Sri Lanka known for its historical sites, beautiful landscapes,
        and cultural attractions. It is home to the Temple of the Tooth, which is a major Buddhist shrine, and the Kandy
        Esala Perahera, which is a colorful and elaborate festival held annually in the city.</p>
