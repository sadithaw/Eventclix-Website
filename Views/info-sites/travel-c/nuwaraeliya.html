      <h1>History</h1>

      <p>Nuwara Eliya is a city located in the central hills of Sri Lanka. It was founded in the 19th century by British
        colonists who were attracted to the area's cool climate and scenic beauty. The city was developed as a hill
        station, a type of resort town that was popular among the British during the colonial period.<br><br>

        Nuwara Eliya was designed to resemble a typical English village, with English-style bungalows, hotels, and
        buildings, as well as parks and gardens. It quickly became a popular tourist destination, especially for
        travelers who were seeking a break from the hot and humid climate of the lowlands.

        In addition to its status as a tourist destination, Nuwara Eliya also became an important center of tea
        production. The surrounding hills are covered with tea plantations, and the city is home to several tea
        factories. The region's cool climate and high altitude make it well-suited for growing high-quality tea.<br><br>

        Today, Nuwara Eliya is still a popular tourist destination and is known for its English-style architecture,
        natural beauty, and tea production. It is also a popular destination for outdoor activities such as hiking,
        golfing, and horse riding.
